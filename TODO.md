# TODO

## General
- model done ?
- kfold done
- validation done
- infra (cli, ...) done
- presentation
- paper
- context (?)

## Taku
- validation donde
- data analysis


## Louis
- kfold done 
- infra done


## Context:

### Ideas:
- CLI application, which predicts the ddG based on two input sequences (useful for protein engineering / general)
- CLI application, which predicts the ddG based on input names? (suppose you have two named proteins / some known mutation and want to find out its effect)
- UMAP/cluster proof of concept on our embeddings -> classfication based on ddG/mutation type -> larger scale
